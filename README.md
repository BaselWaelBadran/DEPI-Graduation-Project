## Setup
1. Create and activate the conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate melanoma_classification
```

2. Verify the installation:
```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

## Dataset
The project uses the Melanoma Cancer dataset containing skin lesion images. The dataset is organized into different classes representing various types of skin conditions.

## Model
The project implements a deep learning model for skin lesion classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Training
To train the model:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

## Evaluation
To evaluate the model:
```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

## Results
The model's performance metrics and visualizations are stored in the `results/` directory.
